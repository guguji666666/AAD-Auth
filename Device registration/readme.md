## Device status in Azure AD

For `AAD registered` devices running windows OS , you can login the device with the local account on that machine.

For `Azure AD joined` devices running windows OS , you must login the device with work account ( normally created in Azure AD )

For `Hybrid Azure AD joined` devices running windows OS , you must login the device with domain accounts ( these accounts should also be synchronized to Azure AD )
