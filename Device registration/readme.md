## Device status in Azure AD

For AAD registered devices running windows OS , you can login the device with the local account on that machine.

For Azure AD joined devices running windows OS , you must login the device with work account ( normally created in Azure AD )

For Hybrid Azure AD joined devices running windows OS , you must login the device with domain accounts ( these accounts should also be synchronized to Azure AD )![image](https://github.com/guguji666666/GJS-AAD-Auth/assets/96930989/76b86819-1f0c-4f14-919f-11ae32583a92)
